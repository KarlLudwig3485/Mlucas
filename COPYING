Comment:
 One of the authors Tomer Hebe did not specify
 which BSD License he was referring to.
 We assume it is the BSD 3-Clause License found on Debian 8 systems.
 .
 One of the authors Jason Papadopoulos placed his contribution
 into the public domain, but disclaimed any responsibility.
 If this is legally allowed, then his contribution is in the public domain.
 Otherwise, regard it as a permissive license with disclaimer.
